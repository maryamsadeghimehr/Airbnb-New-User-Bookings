Where will a new guest book their first travel experience? (Kaggle Competition)

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand. In this kaggle competition, Airbnb challenges you to predict in which country a new user will make his or her first booking.
